# CarND-Controls-MPCSelf-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program---### The Model: Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.The model includes the vehicle's x and y coordinates, the orientation, velocity, the cross-track error and orientation error and also we include actuators acceleration and delta. I use the kinematic bicycle model equations that was given in the classroom section to combine the state and actuators values of the current and previous time steps.### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt): Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.I have chosen for N and dt are 10 and 0.1. I have tried few values for N and dt like (20 and 0.05), (10 and 0.05), (15, 0.1). But I feel the value that I have chosen works pretty fine than the others.### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing: A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.I have transformed the waypoints by converting the coordinates to the vehicle's coordinates in the main.cpp file. Thus making us way to fit the polynomial to the waypoints easily as the x,y and orientation angle becomes 0 initially. Polynomial fitting is done using polyfit method Adapted from https://github.com/JuliaMath/Polynomials.jl/blob/master/src/Polynomials.jl#L676-L716## Model Predictive Control with Latency: The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.Instead of taking the values that are available at the particular point in time and using them for calcualting the errors and then taking corrective actions, I have predicted where the states will be after 100ms in time using our vehicle model's formulae of future state prediction which is found below.// x_[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt// y_[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt// psi_[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt// v_[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt// cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt// epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dtThen substitube 0 for x,y and psi at t for initial state in the above equations and assign them to the present state to counter the problem of latency.## Dependencies* cmake >= 3.5 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)* gcc/g++ >= 5.4  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.    ```    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets    cd uWebSockets    git checkout e94b6e1    ```    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x.
